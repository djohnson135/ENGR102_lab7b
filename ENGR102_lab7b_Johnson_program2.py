"""This program is meant to give you practice with lists and looping on them, as well as practice with vector
computations.
Write a program that lets a user enter two vectors, A and B, of arbitrary dimension. You should allow
the user to first enter the dimension of the vector, then get the elements of the two vectors from the
user. Then, you should output (in a clearly labeled way), the results of these computations:
• The magnitude of vector A and the magnitude of vector B
• A + B
• A – B
• And the dot product (inner product) of A and B
Note: You should use lists when solving this problem. Later we will see some other ways to work with
vectors more directly."""
