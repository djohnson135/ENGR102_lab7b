"""This program is meant to help give you practice with string manipulation.
“Pig Latin” is a way of converting words in standard English to similar words that sound different. The
rules for converting from standard words to Pig Latin are as follows:
• If a word starts with a consonant, move the consonants to the end of the word, and add “ay” to
the end.
o e.g. “computer” becomes “omputercay”
• If a word starts with a vowel, add “yay” on to the end of the word.
o e.g. “engineering” becomes “engineeringyay”
• Note: treat “y” as a vowel for this assignment.
Write a program that repeatedly reads in a word from a user and converts it to Pig Latin. The program
should continue reading words until the user enters “stop”.
Challenge: Try to write a program where, instead of just one word, the user enters an entire sentence,
and all words in the sentence are converted to Pig Latin."""
